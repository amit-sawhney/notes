\dfn{Addition Principle}{
    If $S_1$, $S_2$, $\dots$, $S_k$ are disjoint sets, then

    \begin{align*}
        \Big | S = \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} S_i \Big | = |S_1| + |S_2| + \cdots + |S_k|

    How many ways are there to match $2n$ people? \\

    There are clearly $(2n)!$ ways to arrange $2n$ poeople. Let the first
    two people be on a team, the next two people be on a team, and so on.
    We can swap the people in each team to generate an equivalent arragement
    of people. Given that there are $n$ pairs, there are $2^n$ ways to pick which
    pairs are being swapped. Moreso, there are $n$ pairs so $n!$ ways to
    arrange the pairs. Thus, the number of pairs is $\frac{(2n)!}{2^n\cdot n!}$.

    How many ways are there to form a three-letter sequence using the
    letters a,b,c,d,e,f?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item with repetition of letters allowed?
        \item without repetition of any letter?
        \item without repetition and containing the letter e?
        \item with repetition and containing the letter e?
    \end{itemize}
}
\sol{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item with repetition of letters allowed

              Trivially, there are $6$ choices at each of the three positions in the
              sequence, so there are $6^3 = 216$ ways to form the sequence.

        \item without repetition of any letter

              There are $6$ choices for the first letter, $5$ choices for the second letter,
              and $4$ choices for the third letter. Thus, there are $6\cdot5\cdot4 = 120$ ways
              to form the sequence.

        \item without repetition and containing the letter e

              There are three posibilities. The first letteer is e, the second
              letter is e, or the third letter is e. Each of the arragements within
              each of these three cases are disjoint. So, we can use the Addition
              Principle. In each case there are $5$ choices for the first free position
              and $4$ choices for the second free position. Thus, there are $3\cdot5\cdot4 = 60$
              ways to form the sequence.

        \item with repetition and containing the letter e

              There are three cases: there is $1$ e, $2$ e's, or $3$ e's \\

              In case 1, there are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to pick the position of the
              $1$ e. Then, there are $5$ choices for the first free position and $5$ choices
              for the second free position. Thus, there are $\binom{3}{1}\cdot5\cdot5 = 75$
              the sequence. \\

              In case 2, there are $\binom{3}{2}$ ways to pick the position of the $2$ e's.
              Then, there are $5$ choices for the remaining free position. Thus, there are
              $\binom{3}{2}\cdot5 = 15$ ways to form the sequence. \\

              In total, there are $75 + 15 + 1=91$ ways to form this sequence.

\qs{}{
    A rumor is spread randomly among a group of 10 people by
    successively choosing one specified person (who will start the
    rumor) to call someone, who calls someone etc. A person can pass a
    rumor to anyone except the person who just called and him/herself. \\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item How many different paths can a rumor travel through
              the group in three calls? $n$ calls?
        \item What is the probability that if $A$ starts the rumor,
              $A$ received the third call?

    \end{itemize}
}
\sol{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First question

              There are $10$ ways to pick the first person that starts the rumor.
              The first person can call anyone except himself/herself. So,
              there are $9$ choices. Each the of the next people can call
              anyone except the person who just called and himself/herself.
              So, there are $8$ choices. Thus, there are $10\cdot 9\cdot8 = 72$ ways
              This logic applies to the third group of calls. Thus, there are
              $10\cdot 9\cdot 8\cdot 8 = 5760$ ways to travel through the group in three calls.

              In $n$ calls, there  are $10\cdot 9\cdot 8\cdot \cdots \cdot 8 = 10\cdot 9\cdot 8^{n-1}$ ways
              to travel through the group.

        \item Second question

              By our previous logic, there are $9\cdot 8^{2}$ ways to travel
              through the group in $3$ calls starting from $A$. (Note: we fixed
              the starting person to be $A$). The number of paths that start at $A$,
              travel through an intermediate person $B$ for the first call,
              travel through an intermediate person $C$ for the second call,
              and travel through $A$ for the third call is $9\cdot 8$ as there
              are $9$ choices for the first call, $8$ choices for the second call,
              and $1$ choice for the last call. So the probability is
              $\frac{9\cdot 8}{9\cdot 8\cdot 8} = \frac{1}{8}$.

\dfn{Subtraction Principle}{

    Until recently, area codes were created with the following rules:

    \end{enumerate}

    In 1995 this was abandoned when 360 was used in parts of western
    Washington state (0 still can't be the first number).
}

\sol{
    This is an application of subtraction principle. There are
    $8\cdot 2\cdot 10$ total area codes before the new rule. There are
    $9\cdot 10\cdot 10$ total area codes after the new rule. Thus,
    the number of area codes that were created is:

    \begin{align*}
        9\cdot 10\cdot 10 - 8\cdot 2\cdot 10 = 740

\section{L3: Permutations and selections of sets I}

\subsection*{Permutations of sets}

Let $S = \{a, b, c\}$. There are $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3!$ ways to rearrange this set.
This can also be thought of as creating a bijection from an $n$-set to another $n$-set.\\

In this class, we think of permutations is to think of them in the context of the set
$\{1, 2,\dots, n\}$.

\ex{}{
    Let $S = \{\text{A deck of cards}\}$. Then a permutation of $S$ is a shuffling of the deck.
}

\dfn{$r$-permutation}{
    We can think of this as shuffling a subset $r < n=52$ of all cards.
}

\thm{}{
    Let $P(n,r)$ be the number of $r$-permutations of an $n$-set. Clearly, by the multiplication
    principle, we get that if $r \le n$:

    \begin{align*}
        P(n,r) = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times (n - r + 1)
    \end{align*}

    Clearly, $P(n,n) = n!$ (i.e. when $r=n$).
}

\qs{}{
    Consider the Movable $15$ puzzle problem:

    \begin{align*}
        \begin{matrix*}
            4 & 15 & 8 & 13 \\
            5 & 11 &   & 7 \\
            1 & 12 & 3 & 10 \\
            14 & 2 & 6 & 9
        \end{matrix*}
    \end{align*}

    The goal is to order the numbers from $1$ to $15$ by utilizing the empty space to move
    the numbers around. How many starting puzzles are possible?
}
\sol{
    There are $16!$ ways to arrange $16$ symbols to start $(1, 2, \dots 15)$ and the empty square.
}

\ex{}{
    Consider the TV show episode where James Randi asks an auro reader to guess the order of
    $5$ people behind a curtain without seeing them and simply be reading their auro. \\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Why is it less than a $1\%$ chance that the "auro reader" gets it right?
        \item (Harder) Why is the expectation $1$. (Try the case of three people first.)
    \end{itemize}
}
\sol{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Probability

              There are $5!$ ways to arrange the $5$ people. So the probability is
              $\frac{1}{5!} = \frac{1}{120} < 1\%$.

        \item Expectation

              We need dearragements. The expectation is

              \begin{align*}
                  \sum_{i=0}^5 i \times \text{ Prob(exactly i correct)}
              \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
}

\ex{Circular Permutations}{
    Suppose $n$ children are arranged in a circle. How many arrangemens are there? \\

    There are $n!$ ways to arrange the children in this circle. However $n$ of the circles
    generated will just be rotations of each other. So the number of distinct arrangements
    is $\frac{n!}{n} = (n-1)!$.
}

Similarly, we can derive the following theorem:

\thm{}{
    The number of circular permutations of a set of $n$ elements is $$\frac{P(n,r)}{r}$$
}

\qs{}{
    Ten people, including two who don't want to sit next to one another are seated at a round table.
    How many arrangements are possible?
}
\sol{
    Let $A$ and $B$ be the people that do not want to sit by each other. Construct an algorithm that
    places $A$ and $B$ at the table and then places the remaining $8$ people. \\

    There are $10$ choices for $A$. Because $B$ cannot sit next to $A$, there are only $7$
    choices for $B$. There are $8!$ ways to arrange the remaining $8$ people at the table. However,
    $10$ of the arrangements of this algorithm will be rotations of each other. So the number of
    ways to arrange the $10$ people such that $A$ and $B$ don't sit next to each other is
    $$\frac{10\cdot 7 \cdot 8!}{10}$$
}
\sol{
    Another way to approach this problem is to determine the number of possible arragements with
    no restrictions and take out the bad arragements. Clearly, there are $\frac{10!}{10}$ arragements
    of $10$ people at a round table. To determine the number of bad permutations,
    join person $A$ and $B$ to be represented under one symbol. There are $9$ symbols to
    seat at the table now. By the same principle as above, there are $\frac{9!}{9}=8!$ ways to
    construct this arragement. However, within the joined symbol there could be $AB$ or $BA$.
    So the total number of bad arragements is $2\cdot 8!$. So the total number of arragements
    where $A$ and $B$ are not sitting next to each other is $9! - 2\cdot 8!$.

}

\dfn{}{
    Define

    \begin{align*}
        C(n,r) := \binom{n}{k} = \frac{P(n,r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}

    to be the binomial coeicient. This is the number o ways o choosing $r$ elements in an $n$
    element set.

    If a 5-card hand is chosen at random, what is the probability of obtaining a flush

    and two of another kind, e.g., three queens and two "4"'s)
}
\sol{
    For a flush, there are $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose the suit and $\binom{13}{5}$ ways to
    choose $5$ cards of that suit. There are $\binom{52}{5}$ possible hands of $5$ cards.
    So the probability of getting a flush is $$\frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{13}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$

    For a full house, there are $\binom{13}{1}$ ways to choose the three of a kind card and
    $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to pick the suits from the cards. Similarly, there are $\binom{12}{1}$
    remaining ways to pick the two of a kind card and $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to pick the suits. So,
    the totoal probability is
    $$\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{3}\binom{12}{1}\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$

\qs{}{
    How many starting setups are there in Chess 960? In this game, the back row can be rearranged
    in any way before the game starts as long as it abides by the following two rules:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The bishops are placed on opposite colors.
        \item The king is between the two rooks.
    \end{enumerate}
}

\sol{
    There are two ways to solve this question.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item First way

              We will construct an algorith that places the bishops down, then places the rooks and king together,
              and then places the remaining pieces. \\

              There are $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to place one bishop and $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to place the other. Thus,
              $\binom{4}{1} \binom{4}{1} = 4\cdot 4 = 16$ ways to place the bishops. We can then imagine the board with
              6 remaining places. We then must place the rooks and king together. There are 4 cases where the king can be
              on any ".":
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item R.R

                        There are $4$ ways to place the rooks this distance apart.
                        There is only $1$ way to place the king in this arrangement.
                        So there are $4$ possible arrangements of this form.

                  \item R..R

                        There are 3 ways to place the rooks this distance apart.
                        Thee are 2 ways to place the king in between these rooks.
                        So there are $3\cdot 2 = 6$ possible arrangements of this form.

                  \item R...R

                        There are $2$ ways to place the rooks this distance apart.
                        There are $3$ ways to place the king in between these rooks.
                        So there are $2\cdot 3 = 6$ possible arrangements of this form.

                  \item R....R

                        There is $1$ way to place the rooks this distance apart.
                        There are $4$ ways to place the king in between these rooks.
                        So there are $1\cdot 4 = 4$ possible arrangements of this form.
              \end{itemize}

              At this point we have placed 5 of the 8 pieces. So there are $\frac{3!}{2!}$
              ways to place the next three pieces, given that their are two knights
              which are identitcal.

              All in all, there are $16\cdot (4 + 6 + 6 + 4)\cdot 3 = 960$. Hence,
              why it is called Chess 960.

        \item Second way,

              We can start by repeating the start of the previous algorithm. So,
              we place the bishops down in 16 ways. Then we place the queen. There are
              6 ways to do this. Then we place the knights which is possible in $5 choose 2$ ways.
              At this point, the position of the king and two rooks are forced. So,
              there are $16\cdot 6\cdot \binom{5}{2} = 960$ ways to arrange the pieces.
    \end{enumerate}

    \nt{
        A really important part of this chapter to take away is the process
        of constructing an algorithm to calculate the number of ways to arrange
        a set of objects.

\section{L4: Permutations and selections of sets II: binomial identities}

\subsection*{Binomial Identities}

These are incredibly useful for combinatorics. Typically, if you are going to try
to prove binomial identities algabraically (i.e. directly from the definition),
they can be quite difficult, but thinking about them combinatorically can make
them easier to understand.

\thm{}{
    For $0 \le r \le n$, we have $$\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n - r}$$
}

\begin{subproof}{(Algabraic)}
    Obviously,

    \begin{align*}
        \binom{n}{r} & = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}              \\
                     & = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}              \\
                     & = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! (n - (n - r))!} \\
                     & = \binom{n}{n-r}
    \end{align*}

    However, this only works for simple binomial identities.
\end{subproof}

\begin{subproof}{(Combinatoric)}
    The LHS counts the number of ways to choose $r$ people from $n$ people.
    This equivalent to counting which of the $n$ people to exclude from our
    group. There are $n-r$ people to exclude. So, there are $\binom{n}{n-r}$.
    Clearly, this is the RHS. So the LHS and the RHS count the same set and thus
    are equivalent.
\end{subproof}

\thm{Pascal's Formula}{
    For all integers, $n$ and $k$ with $1 \le k \le n-1$,

    \begin{align*}
        \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n - 1}{k} + \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}
    \end{align*}
}
\begin{subproof}
    Let $T$ be a set of $n$ elements such that $T=\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$. Suppose $S$ is a subset of $T$ with
    $k$ elements. There are two cases:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $x_1 \in S$. Then, there are $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ ways
              to choose the remaining elements in $S$.
        \item $s_1 \not\in S$. Then, there are $\binom{n-1}{k}$ ways to
              to choose the elements in $S$.
    \end{itemize}

    By the addition principle there are $\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$ ways
    to choose $k$ elements from $T$. So, the equality holds as the LHS and RHS
    count the same set (i.e. the set of all subsets of $T$ with $k$ elements).
\end{subproof}

\subsection*{Combinatorial Models}

\dfn{Lattice Paths}{
    Think of $\binom{a+b}{a}$ as the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$
}

\ex{}{
    Prove that

    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{j=0}^{b} \binom{a+j-1}{a-1} = \binom{a+b}{a}

    \begin{subproof}
        Let $S$ be the set of all lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ using
        only right (east) and up (north) moves. Clearly, the RHS counts the
        the number of paths in $S$. Now decompose each path in $S$ into the paths
        at the last time that the path touches the verticle line $x=a-1$. There are
        $b+1$ places that a path can touch the line $x=a-1$. After the last time
        it touches this line, the remaining path to $(a,b)$ is fixed (directly up).
        Each of these elements in the resulting decomposition is disjoint. So, we
        can apply the addition principle. Suppose $j$ is the $y$-coordinate that the
        path touches the line $x=a-1$. Then, there are $\binom{a+j-1}{a-1}$ ways
        to reach this point. So, there are $\sum_{j=0}^{b} \binom{a+j-1}{a-1}$ ways
        to count all of the paths that last touch the line $x=a-1$ which is the
        LHS. So, the LHS and RHS count the same set and thus are equivalent.
    \end{subproof}
}

\qs{}{
    Prove the same identity as above, expressed diferently:

    \begin{subproof}
        Let $S$ be the set of all sequences with $n+1$ elements containing only
        $0$ and $1$ and $r+1$ $1$'s. Clearly, the RHS counts the number of
        sequences by picking which of the $n+1$ positions will be $1$. We can
        decompose $S$ by removing the last instance of $1$ from each sequence.
        This $1$ could be at position $0, 1, \dots, n+1$. Let $k$ be the position
        before the last $1$. Then, there are $\binom{k}{r}$ ways to choose the
        remaining $1$'s in the sequence. Given this, $k$ can range from $0$ to $n$
        as it cannot be greater than $n$ as that would imply there are $0$ $1$'s
        in the sequence. So, by the addition principle there are
        $$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{k}{r}$$
        total ways to count this decomposition. So, the LHS and RHS count the same
        set and thus are equivalent.

        RHS clealy counts this set. Consider the line $y=n-x$ and the point
        $(j, n-j)$. Decompose $S$ into the paths that touch this line at an
        arbitrary point $(j, n-j)$. Clearly, the number of lattice paths to
        this point is $\binom{j + (n - j)}{j} = \binom{n}{j}$. Additionally,
        the number of paths from this point to
        $(n,n)$ is $\binom{n-j + j}{n-j} = \binom{n}{n-j} = \binom{n}{j}$.
        This is because we can rewrite the destination point as
        $(n-j, n - (n-j)) = (n-j, j)$ and think of the starting point as
        the origin. By the addition principle,

        \begin{align*}
            \sum_{j=0}^{n} \binom{n}{j}^2
        \end{align*}

        So, the LHS and RHS count the same set and thus are equivalent.

    It may help to read a later chapter to fully understand what a

    as the lattice path ends at $y=b$. Similarly, the largest part

\section{L5: Permutations and Combinations of multisets I}

\textbf{Multisets}: A multiset is a set that allows for repeated elements. \\

\noindent
This leads us to a common question regarding permutations: How many permutations
are there in a multiset.

\thm{}{
    The number of "words" (meaning permutations) one can generate out of $k$
    letters (elements in the multiset) which appears
    $n_1, n_2, \cdots, n_k$ times is

    \begin{align*}
        \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_k!}
    \end{align*}

    where $n=n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_k$.
}

\begin{subproof}
    Imagine we distinguish the letters the repeated letters in a multiset.
    For example,

    \begin{align*}
        \{I_1, L_1, L_2, I_2, N_1, O_1, S_1 \}
    \end{align*}

    There are $n!= 8!$ ways to arrange the letters. Ignoring the subscripts,
    we can see how many times we overcount. For example, there are $3$ Is. Which means
    we overcount by a factor of $3!$. Similarly, there are $2$ Ls, $1$ O,
    $1$ N, and $1$ S. So, the number of permutations is

    \begin{align*}
        \frac{8!}{3!\cdot 2!\cdot 1! \cdot 1!\cdot 1! }
    \end{align*}
\end{subproof}

\qs{}{
    Consider the $5!=120$ permutations of the letters $a,b,c,d,e$.
    How do you determine the $40th$ one (in alphabetical order) quickly?
}
\sol{
    We know that the first permutation starts with $a$. Additionally, with
    $4$ remaining letters to permute, there are $4!=24$ permutations that start
    with $a$. So, permutations starting with $a$ are in between $1$ and $24$.
    Permutations with $b$ are between $25$ and $48$. So, we know that the 40th
    permutation starts with $b$. Similarly, permutations starting with $ba$
    are in the range of $25$ to $30$, $bc$ are in the range of $31$ to $36$,
    $bd$ are in the range of $37$ to $42$. So, the 40th permutation starts
    with $bd$. Contuining on $bda$ are in the range of $37$ to $38$ and
    $bdc$ are in the range of $39$ to $40$. So, the 40th permutation is
    $bdcea$.

\subsection*{Basic Combination Question}

How many ways are there to select an \_r-combination\_ (size $r$ multi-subset) of a multiset?

\subsubsection*{Example}
For the $I,L,L,I,N,O,I,S$ example, if $r=3$, possible 3-combinations are:
$$\{I,L,I\},\{I,I,I\}, \{N,O,S\}, \dots$$

\thm{}{
    The number of $r$-combinations of $k$ distinct objects, each with
    unlimited supply is $C(k+r-1,r)$.
}

\begin{subproof}
    Let $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k$ be the number of times one uses object
    $A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_k$. So, we know:

    \begin{align*}
        x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = r
    \end{align*}

    \noindent
    and each $x_i \ge 0$ is a nonnegative integer.
    This is counted by $C(k+r-1,r)$. (Keep reading, we need to prove this)
\end{subproof}

\subsubsection*{Proof that compositions are counted by $C(k+r-1,r)$}

We need to prove that the number of

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compositions of $r$ into nonnegative integers
    \item Number of ways of selecting $r$ things from $k$ objects with repetition
\end{itemize}

\noindent
is counted by $C(k+r-1,r)$.

\begin{subproof}
    Based on our previous problem, we know that each of these is counted
    by the same thing. Consider the following construction, \\

    Lay out $r$ objects in a row. Then, in order to to form $k$ groups,
    we can place down $k-1$ dividers. So, we have $k-1$ choices of where
    to place the dividers and $r+k-1$ positions in which they can be placed.
    So, the number of ways to place the dividers is

    \begin{align*}
        C(r+k-1,k-1) & = \binom{r+k-1}{k-1}         \\
                     & = \binom{r+k-1}{r+k-1-(k-1)} \\
                     & = \binom{r+k-1}{r}

By nature, the pigeonhole principle creates structure in randomness. In other words,
if there is a long enough sequence of random numbers, there must be a random structure.

from solid to fluid, a freezing point of sorts. More philsophically, out of

        q_1 + q_2 + \cdots + q_n - n + 1
    \end{align*}

    obects are distributed into $n$ boxes, the either box $1$ contains
    $q_1$ objects, or box $2$ contains $q_2$ objects, or $\cdots$, or
    box $n$ contains $q_n$ objects.
}
\begin{subproof}
    Suppose not. That is suppose that no box contains $q_i$ objects.
    Then there are at most

    \begin{align*}
        (q_1 - 1) + (q_2 - 1) + \cdots + (q_n - 1) = q_1 + q_2 + \cdots + q_n - n
    \end{align*}

    objects in the $n$ boxes. However this is a contradiction because we
    distributed $q_1 + q_2 + \cdots + q_n - n + 1$ objects into $n$ boxes.
\end{subproof}

\subsubsection*{Special cases}

There are two special cases of the strong pigeonhole principle.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $q_i=2$ for each $i$, this implies the weak pigeonhole principle.

          For clarity, let $q_i=2$ for each $i$. Then, the strong pigeonhole
          principle says that if

          \begin{align*}
              q_1 + q_2 + \cdots + q_n - n + 1 = 2n - n + 1
               & = n + 1
          \end{align*}
          objects are distributed into $n$ boxes, then either box $1$ contains
          $2$ objects, or box $2$ contains $2$ objects, or $\dots$, or box $n$
          contains $2$ objects. In other words, one of the boxes contains $2$
          objects.

    \item Suppose $q_i=r$ for each $i$. This implies that if you distribute
          $rn - n + 1 = n(r-1)+1$ objects into $n$ boxes, then one of the boxes
          contains at least $r$ objects.

          A small reformation of this case is that if the average of
          $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n > r-1$ then at least one $a_i \ge r$. This is
          pretty easy to see.

          \begin{subproof}
              Suppose not. That is suppose that no $a_i \ge r$. Then each
              $a_i \le r-1$. So, at most the average of $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n$
              is $r-1$. However, this is a contradiction because the average
              is greater than $r-1$.

        Without loss of generality, assume that $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n^2+1}$

        $L_k$ be the longest increasing subsequence starting at $a_k$. Clearly,

        $n+1$.

        Consider the sequence, $L_1, L_2, \dots, L_{n^2 + 1}$.
        Note that $n^2 + 1 = n((n+1)-1)+1$. By the strong pigeonhole
        principle, where $r=n+1$, this implies that $n+1$ of the $L_k$'s
        are equal which can be denoted by
        $L_{k_1} = L_{k_2} = \cdots = L_{k_{n+1}}$. From this, we can

        It may not be clear that this is a decreasing subsequence. Suppose not.
        That is, suppose that $a_{k_i} < a_{k_{i+1}}$ for some $i$. Then,
        $L_{k_i} > L_{k_{i+1}}$ because we can construct a longer increasing
        subsequence than $L_{k_{i+1}}$ by adding $a_{k_i}$ to the start of the
        sequence that starts at $a_{k_{i+1}}$. However, this is a contradiction
        because $L_{k_i} = L_{k_{i+1}}$. So, this must be a decreasing subsequence.

    $R(r,s)$ always exists. In fact,

\begin{subproof}
    This is done by double induction on $r,s \ge 1$. \\

    \subsubsection*{Base Case}

    \begin{align*}
        R(r,1) = R(1,s)= 1
    \end{align*}

    This is clearly true, because a complete graph with $1$ vertex is gaurunteed to have a
    subgraph on $1$ vertex that is blue or red. The color chosen is irrelevant because there are no edges
    so the color is implicit. \\

    Trivially the inequality (i.e. the base case holds true) holds because:

    \begin{align*}
         & R(r,1) \le R(r-1,1) + R(r,1-1) \iff 1 \le 1 + 0 \iff 1 \le 1 \\
         & R(1,s) \le R(1-1,s) + R(1,s-1) \iff 1 \le 0 + 1 \iff 1 \le 1
    \end{align*}

    \subsubsection*{Inductive Step}

    Suppose that $R(r-1,s)$ and $R(r,s-1)$ exist and consider the complete graph with
    $R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1)$ vertices. Pick a vertex $v$. There are $R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1) - 1$
    edges incident to $v$. Split the adjacent vertices $w$ into two classes, RED and BLUE,
    depending on if $(v,w)$ is a red or blue edge. Clearly,

    \begin{align*}
        R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1) = |RED| + |BLUE| + 1
    \end{align*}

    The LHS represnts the total number of vertices in the original graph we constructed. The RHS is the
    decomposition of this graph based on an arbitrary vertex $v$ based on the adjacent edge
    colors. Because the graph is complete, RED and BLUE will contain every vertex in the original
    graph except the arbitrary vertex $v$ which is why we add $1$. Thus, I claim that one of the
    following must be true:

    \begin{align*}
        |RED|  & \ge R(r-1,s) \\
        |BLUE| & \ge R(r,s-1)
    \end{align*}

    Suppose not. That is suppose that both $|RED| < R(r-1,s)$ and $|BLUE| < R(r,s-1)$.
    Then, $|RED| + 1 \le R(r-1,s)$ and $|BLUE| + 1 \le R(r,s-1)$

    \begin{align*}
        |RED| + |BLUE| + 2 & \le R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1) \\
        |RED| + |BLUE| + 1 & < R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1)
    \end{align*}

    But this is a contradiction as $|RED| + |BLUE| + 1 = R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1)$. So either
    $|RED| \ge R(r-1,s)$ or $|BLUE| \ge R(r,s-1)$ \\

    Without loss of generality, suppose that $|RED| = R(r-1,s)$. Then, the vertices
    in RED, must have a red $K_{r-1}$ or a blue $K_{s}$. If the former is true, then
    this $K_{r-1}$ with $v$ forms a $K_{r}$ within the original graph (as each vertex in
    RED was connected to $v$ with a red edge). Otherwise, the latter is true and thus the original
    graph contains a $K_{s}$. In either case, the original graph contains a $K_{r}$ or
    a $K_{s}$. Thus, not only does $R(r,s)$ exist but the inequality holds true as we
    either need one less vertices than what is in $R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1)$ or we need
    to include the same number of vertices as $R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1)$.

    \begin{align*}
        R(r,s) \le R(r-1,s) + R(r,s-1)

\section{L10: Binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem I}

Recall the following two facts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$
    \item $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}$
\end{itemize}

\nt{
    One can think o Pascal's formula (the second fact) as the recursive definition the compute
    binomial coefficients with the following initial conditions:

    \begin{align*}
        \binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1
    \end{align*}
}

\subsubsection*{Properties of the Binomial Coefficients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The row sums give powers of $2$
    \item The symmetry of the binomial coefficient.
    \item The number $\binom{n}{k}$ is the number of paths SW-NE "/" and NW-SE "$\backslash$" steps from
          $\binom{0}{0}$ to $(n,k)$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{subproof}
    Proof of third property: \\

    The only way to get to $\binom{n}{k}$ is to pass through $\binom{n-1}{k}$ or $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.
    From here, we can apply induction and pascal's formula to show that this is true.
\end{subproof}

\qs{}{
    Write Pascal's triangle as follows:

            1 & 2 & 1 & & & \\

    these numbers beore. What are they? (Can you give a proof?)

\sol{
    Clearly this sequence is $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \dots$. This is the Fibonacci sequence. \\

    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

    \begin{align*}
        a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}
    \end{align*}

    While this can be solved with recursion we can craft a combinatorial model to represent this
    situation. Consider the $n$-the Fibonacci number and a strip of length $n$. Imagine we are going
    to fill this strip with Rabbits (size $1$) and Cadillacs (size $2$). At a point $n$, we have two
    choices,

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Place a Rabbit and lose one space
        \item Place a caddilac and lose two spaces
    \end{enumerate}

    Clearly, this is defined by the recurrence above. We can use a Rabbit and thus there are $a_{n-1}$
    ways to fill the strip or we can use a Cadillac and thus there are $a_{n-2}$ ways to fill the strip.

    is the number of ways to choose $i$ $x$s and $j$ $y$s where $i+j=n$ which is:

    \begin{align*}

\thm{Unimodality of Binomial Coefficients}{
    Binomial Coefficients are unimodal.
}

\subsubsection*{Intuition/Philosophy}

Consider a unimodal sequence of natural numbers
$$a_1 \le a_2 \le \cdots \le a_m \ge a_{m+1} \ge \cdots \ge a_n$$

This sequence should lead you to some conclusions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $a_1 = \#S_1$, $a_2 = \#S_2$, $\dots$, $a_n = \#S_n$. So this original sequence counts the size
          of some sets:

          \begin{align*}
              S_1, S_2, \dots, S_m, \dots, S_n
          \end{align*}

          Our main motivation for this representation is because of what follows:

    \item Recall that if there exists an injection from a set $A \to B$, then $A \le B$. Using this logic,
          it is clear that there are injective maps:

          \begin{align*}
              S_1 \hookrightarrow S_2, S_2 \hookrightarrow S_3, \dots, S_{m-1} \hookrightarrow S_m, \dots, S_{n-1} \hookrightarrow S_n
          \end{align*}

    \item Similarly, recall that if there is a surjection from a set $A \to B$, then $A \ge B$. Using
          this logic, it is clear that there are surjective maps:

          \begin{align*}
              S_m \twoheadrightarrow S_{m+1}, S_{m+1} \twoheadrightarrow S_{m+2}, \dots, S_{n-1} \twoheadrightarrow S_n
          \end{align*}

          Thus, to clarify some syntax:

          \begin{align*}
              |A| \le |B| & \iff A \hookrightarrow B    \\
              |A| \ge |B| & \iff A \twoheadrightarrow B
          \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Proof of Binomial Coefficient Unimodality}

\begin{subproof}
    Consider the fact that $\binom{n}{k}$ counts the lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $v=(k,n-k)$. using
    "N" and "E" steps. Similarly, $\binom{n}{k+1}$ (the next binomial coefficient in the sequence/pascal's
    triangle) counts the lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $w=(k+1,n-k-1)$. Assume that $k < \frac{n}{2}$. We can
    draw a perpendicular bisector between $\overline{vw}$. At this point, note that this bisector must
    intersect the lattice path from $(0,0)$ to $v$ at some point. This is because this lattice path
    must pass through the points $(k, n-k-1)$, $(k-1,n-k-2)$, $\dots$, to some point on the $y$-axis below $n-k$.
    This is because the perpendicular bisector must have a slope of $-1$. Thus, the lattice path must intersect
    with one of these points to get to $k,n-k$. For every lattice path from $(0,0)$ to $v$,
    we can construct a new lattice path from $(0,0)$ to $w$ by applying a reflexive property, reflex
    the lattice path across the perpendicular bisector for every step after the last time the lattice path touches
    the perpendicular bisector. Lastly, this reflected path must reach $w$. Consider the last point $a$ that the
    lattice path touches the bisector. At $a$, the lattice path must take 2 steps up for every step to the right
    in order to reach $v$. Similarly, at this point the lattice path would need to take 2 steps to the right
    for every step up in order to reach $w$ Thus, when reflected at this point, the path that was going to
    reach $v$ must reach $w$. Hence, there exists a injection between the binomial coefficients while
    $k < \frac{n}{2}$. This function must be injective because given two paths that reach
    $w$, we can simply reflect the paths across the perpendicular bisector from the last point of intersection
    to the end of the path and reveal that the paths are the same lattice path to $v$.
    So, for each $k$ where $k < \frac{n}{2}$: We trivially have that $\binom{n}{k} \ne \binom{n}{k+1}$ because
    we can consider lattice paths that go directly to $w$. There is no lattice
    path that goes directly to $v$ that can be a pre-image of this path.

    \begin{align*}
        \binom{n}{k} < \binom{n}{k+1}
    \end{align*}

    \noindent
    Similarly, take $k > \frac{n}{2}$. We can construct the same situtation, except prove that there is an injection
    from point $w$ to $v$ which would imply that:

    \begin{align*}
        \binom{n}{k+1} < \binom{n}{k} \iff \binom{n}{k} > \binom{n}{k+1}
    \end{align*}

    Hence, we have proven that the binomial coefficients are unimodal.

Suppose that you're a designer of houses that you plan to put in a newly
constructed neighbourhood. Each house is basically the same, but can be adorned with
some of the following $n$ upgrades:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hard wood floors
    \item Skylight
    \item Granite Countertops
    \item Stainless stell appliances
    \item $\dots$
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In order to be unique, you want to give each house a different set of options, BUT,
no house A has upgrades that are a subset of another house B's upgrades (otherwise
the owner of house A would be majorized by house B). By doing this, no two houses
are comparable (one house may have hardwood floors, and other a sun roof). \\

\noindent
What is the maximum number of houses you can design under these conditions?

What is the largest size of any antichain on $n$ elements? Note that this is the same
question we posed before in the Applied section above. The answer to this question is
given by Sperner's Theorem.


\dfn{Chains}{
    A \textit{chain} is a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ such that
    if $A, B \in \mathcal{C}$, the either:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $A \subseteq B$ or

    A chain is considered \textit{maximal} if the chain contains one subset
    of each possible size.

\qs{}{
    How many maximal chains of $\{1,2, \dots, n\}$ are there?
}
\sol{
    By the properties of constructing a chain, we can think of building a chain one
    element at a time. There are $n$ choices for the first element in the the chain.
    Let the first choice be called $a$. Then the start of our chain is $\{a\}$. Continuing
    on there are $n-1$ choices for the next part of the chain. Call this $b$. Clearly,
    our chain will be $\Big \{ \{a\}, \{a,b\}, \dots \Big \}$. Following this, there are cleary
    $n!$ possible chains.
}

\thm{Sperner's Theorem}{
    Let $S$ be a set of $n$ elements. Then the maximum size of an antichain is
    $\binom{n}{\floor{\frac{n}{2}}}$
}

\begin{subproof}
    Fix an antichain $\mathcal{A}$. Let $S$ be a set defined by

    \begin{align*}
        S = \{ (a,\mathcal{C}) : a \in \mathcal{A}, \text{ where } \mathcal{C} \text{ is a maximal chain with } a \in \mathcal{C} \}
    \end{align*}

    Note that $a \in \mathcal{C}$ and $a \in \mathcal{A}$. Every maximal chain can only
    intersect with an antichain in one place. Suppose not. That is suppose that
    a maximal chain $\mathcal{C}$ and antichain intersect in more than one place.
    Without loss of generality assume that the chain and anti-chain intersect at
    two subsets, $T_1, T_2$. By the definition of a chain, we have that either
    $T_1 \subseteq T_2$ or $T_2 \subseteq T_1$. Assume $T_1 \subseteq T_2$. Then,
    this is a contradiction. Since $T_1$ and $T_2$ are elements of the antichain,
    they cannot be subsets of each other. So, chains and anti-chains can only intersect
    \textit{once}. Because of this it is clear that the number of maximal chains is
    an upperbound on the size of set $S$. Thus,

    \begin{align*}
        \#S \le n!
    \end{align*}

    Fix $a \in \mathcal{A}$ of size $k$. Exactly $k!(n-k)!$ maximal chains must contain
    $a$. This is because in a maximal chain, it must contain subsets of each size so there
    must be subsets of sizes $1,2, \dots, k-1$. Each of these subsets must be a subset
    of $a$. Thus, with $k$ elements, there are $k!$ ways to build a maximal chain up to
    $a$. Similarly, there are $n-k$ elements left to build the remaining maximal chain.

    Define $a_k$ such that $a_k$ is the number of subsets in $\mathcal{A}$ that are
    of size $k$.

    \begin{align*}
        a_k = \#\{a \in \mathcal{A} : \#a = k\}
    \end{align*}

    It follows that:

    \begin{align*}
        \#A = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k
    \end{align*}

    This sum counts the number of subsets in $\mathcal{A}$ that are of size $k$ for
    all sizes $k$ so it must be the number of elements in the antichain. At this point,
    it can be recognized that:

    \begin{align*}
        \#S = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k k!(n-k)!
    \end{align*}

    This is because for an arbitrary $k$, there are $a_k$ subsets of size $k$ in
    $\mathcal{A}$ and each of these subsets can be paired with $k!(n-k)!$ maximal chains.
    Thus, the total number of elements in $S$ (i.e. the total number of elments in the
    antichain that are in any number of maximal chains) is the sum over all $k$. Thus,

    \begin{align*}
        \#S & = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k k!(n-k)! \le n!                                                                             \\
            & \iff \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k k!(n-k)! \le \frac{1}{n!} n!                                                \\
            & \iff \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k \frac{k!(n-k)!}{n!} \le 1                                                                \\
            & \iff \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k \frac{1}{\binom{n}{k}} \le 1                                                             \\
            & \iff \binom{n}{\floor{\frac{n}{n}}} \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k \frac{1}{\binom{n}{k}} \le \binom{n}{\floor{\frac{n}{n}}} \\
            & \iff \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k \le \binom{n}{\floor{\frac{n}{2}}}
    \end{align*}

    Thus,

    \begin{align*}
        \#\mathcal{A} = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k \le \binom{n}{\floor{\frac{n}{2}}}
    \end{align*}

    So $\binom{n}{\floor{\frac{n}{2}}}$ is an upperbound on the size of an antichain.

    Obviously, $|S| = 1000$. To obtain the number of integers between $a$
    and $b$, where $b \geq a$, we can use the formula $\floor{\frac{b}{a}}$. \\

    To begin, we can realize that the LHS counts the number of elements in $S$
    that are not in any of the $A_i$. \\

    For the RHS, Consider an arbitrary $s \in S$. There are two cases:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case 1. $x$ is not in any $A_i$.

              In this case, $x$ would contribute $1$ to the LHS and $1$ to
              RHS as it will not appear in any of the summations. Thus, this
              value will have no impact on the equality.

        \item Case 2. $x$ is in some $n > 0$ $A_i$ sets.

              Clearly, the contribution to the LHS is $0$. For the RHS,
              the contribution is

              \begin{align*}
                  1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{k} \binom{n}{k}
              \end{align*}

              This is because we must count the number of ways to choose $k$
              sets from the $n$ sets that $x$ is in. \\

              By the binominal theorem, we have

              \begin{align*}
                  1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{k} \binom{n}{k} & = \sum_{k=0}^{n} (1)^{n-k}(-1)^k\binom{n}{k} \\

    In both cases, the equality holds. Thus, the LHS and RHS are equal.

\subsection*{Introduction to Dearrangements}

\textbf{Question}: You all get up from your chairs, and randomly move to a different
chair. What's the probability that no one ends up sitting down
in the same chair? What if it were a class of $300$ students? \\

\nt{
    I find this definition a little hard to initially interpret. \\

    Derrangements can be thought of through the following example.
    Suppose a teacher is attempting to pass back a test to four students:
    $A, B, C, D$. There are obviously $4!$ ways to destribute the tests
    (i.e. there are $4!$ permutations of $A, B, C, D$). \\

    Dearrangements are the number of ways to distribute the tests such that
    no student gets their own test back. \\

    For example $A, C, D, B$ is not a dearragement because $A$ gets their
    own test back. However, $B, A, D, C$ is a dearrangement because no
    student gets their own test back. \\

    Our goal is count the number of dearrangements. \\

    \end{align*}

    Clearly, there are $n!$ permutations in $S_n$. \\

    For each $0 \le i \le n$, there are $(n - 1)!$ permutations where $\pi(i) = i$.
    Thus there are $n(n - 1)!$ permutations where $\pi(i) = i$ for some $i$.
    So,

    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i=1}^{n} |A_i| & = n(n - 1)! \\
                             & = n!
    \end{align*}

    For each $i,j$, there are $(n - 2)!$ permutations where $\pi(i) = i$ and $\pi(j) = j$.
    Thus there are $n(n - 1)(n - 2)!$ permutations where $\pi(i) = i$ and $\pi(j) = j$ for some $i$ and $j$.


    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i,j}^{n} |A_i \cap A_j| & = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)!}{2!} \\
                                      & = \frac{n!}{2}

    This makes sense because there are $n$ choices for $i$ and $n -1$
    choices for $j$ (since $i$ and $j$ cannot be the same). This leaves
    $(n-2)!$ ways to arrange the remaining $n - 2$ elements. However,
    $i$ and $j$ are indistinguishable, so we must divide by $2$ to account
    for this. \\

Find the number of integer solutions to

}
\sol{
    First, let us redefine the problem in terms of new variables with equal
    restrictions but started with $0$ as the lowest bound. \\

    The problem becomes:

    \begin{align*}
        y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 16
    \end{align*}

    subject to $4 \ge y_1 \ge 0$, $6 \ge y_2 \ge 0$, $5 \ge y_3 \ge 0$, $6 \ge y_4 \ge 0$. \\

    Now, let $S$ be the set of solutions where each $y_i \ge 0$. There are clearly,

    \begin{align*}
        \binom{16 + 4 - 1}{16} = \binom{19}{16}
    \end{align*}

    Now, we must solve each of the following intersections, however,
    we only need to consider the cases where the intersection is non-empty.
    This is obviously done by solving this like we have previously
    studied. Subtract $1 + $ the upper bound of each $y_i$ from the
    target value of the sums. And proceed to solve this question
    as a normal stars and bars problem. \\

    \begin{align*}
        |A_1| = \binom{11 + 4 - 1}{11} = \binom{14}{11}      \\
        |A_2| = \binom{9 + 4 - 1}{9} = \binom{12}{9}         \\
        |A_3| = \binom{10 + 4 - 1}{10} = \binom{13}{10}      \\
        |A_4| = \binom{9 + 4 - 1}{9} = \binom{12}{9}         \\
        |A_1 \cup A_2| = \binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4} = \binom{7}{4} \\
        |A_1 \cup A_3| = \binom{5 + 4 - 1}{5} = \binom{8}{5} \\
        |A_1 \cup A_4| = \binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4} = \binom{7}{4} \\
        |A_2 \cup A_3| = \binom{3 + 4 - 1}{3} = \binom{6}{3} \\
        |A_2 \cup A_4| = \binom{2 + 4 - 1}{2} = \binom{5}{2} \\
        |A_3 \cup A_4| = \binom{3 + 4 - 1}{3} = \binom{6}{3} \\
    \end{align*}

    So the final answer is

    \begin{align*}
         & = \binom{19}{16} - \Bigg ( \binom{14}{11} + \binom{12}{9} + \binom{13}{10} + \binom{12}{9}        \\
         & - \binom{7}{4} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{7}{4} - \binom{6}{3} - \binom{5}{2} - \binom{6}{3} \Bigg ) \\
         & = 55

    before? \\

    In other words, count $w$ in $S_n$ that avoid the pairs
    $$1 2, 2 3, \dots, (n - 1) n$$

\sol{
    Let $S_n$ be the set of all permutations of $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.

    Let $A_i$ be the set of all permutations that contain the pair $i i+1$. \\

    Then we want to find
    \begin{align*}
        |S_n| - \Bigg ( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |A_i|     - \sum_{i,j=1}^{n} |A_i \cap A_j| + \cdots + (-1)^{n+1} |A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n| \Bigg )

    Clearly, $|S_n| = n!$ because there are $n!$ permutations. \\

    Now, we must solve each of the following intersections. Observe the following:

    \begin{align*}
        |A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}| = \binom{n-1}{k} (n - k)!
    \end{align*}

    This is because we must think of constructing an algorithm that places the paired
    elements and then places the remaining elements. \\

    This algorithm is represented by the RHS of the above the equation. This
    is because there are only $n-1$ positions where we can place a "block",
    i.e., a pair of elements. Given $k$ blocks, there are $\binom{n-1}{k}$ ways to
    place them. Then, we must place the remaining $n-k$ elements
    which can be done in $(n-k)!$ ways given their distinct ordering \\

    Thus, this gives us the final form of the answer.

    Here $r_k$ is the number of ways to place $k$ rooks in the forbidden squares.
}

\begin{subproof}
    This is an application of the inclusion-exclusion principle. \\

    Let $A_i$ be the set of all placements where exactly one of the
    forbidden squares in row $i$ must be used. Consider the following
    arbitrary intersection of $A_i$s \\

    \begin{align*}
        \sum |A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}|
    \end{align*}

    Note that the sum is over all selections of the $k$ subsets. \\

    This can be observed by constructing an algorithm that places the rooks
    in the forbidden squares and then places the remaining rooks. \\

    There are $r_k$ ways to place the rooks in the forbidden squares. Then,
    there are $n - k$ positions to place the remaining rooks, so there are
    $(n-k)!$ ways to place them. Thus,

    \begin{align*}
        \sum |A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}| = r_k(n-k)!
    \end{align*}

    Substituting this is the inclusion-exclusion principle, we get
    the theorem.

Consider a sequence $$h_0, h_1, h_2, \dots, h_t, \dots$$ of natural numbers where
$h_t$ is the answer to some counting problem that depends on $t$. \\

$$

where $h_t = [x^t]g(x)$.

    We already know from stars and bars that

    $$
        h_t = \binom{t + k - 1}{k - 1}
    $$

    So obviously, the generating series can be written as

    $$
        g(x) = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \binom{t + k - 1}{k - 1}x^t

    \nt{
        This doesn't really tell us anything. We just combined some definitions
        and have a genearting series that is hard to utilize in any useful way.

    We can see that the coefficient of $x^t$ is the number of ways to write $t$ as
    a sum of $k$ nonnegative integers. So,

    $$h_t = \binom{t + k - 1}{k - 1}$$

    This combinatorially proves the negative binomial theorem:

\subsection*{What does it mean for two generating series to be equal?}

They are equal coefficient by coefficient.

\subsection*{Let $g(x)$ be the generating series for the number of partitions.
    What does it mean that $g(x)$ equals the infinite product:
}

\begin{align*}
    g(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - x^{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - x^{3}} \cdots
\end{align*}

It means that if we expand/solve enough terms of the RHS, the coefficient
of $x^t$ will stabalize (as in no more terms multiplied in will impact
the coefficient) and this coefficient will be the same as the coefficient
of $x^t$ in the LHS -- $g(x)$.

\subsection*{Convergence Issues}

Typically, with generating series, we only care about the coefficients and
not plugging in any specfic value into $x$. Because of this, we do not need
to worry about convergence. However, in some cases $g(x)$ is a polynomial
and in these cases, substitution is fine to perform.

\qs{Substituting into a generating series}{
    Let $S = \{$coins in your pokcet$\}$ and $\omega : S \mapsto \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$
    be the obvious weight function on coins, i.e. $\omega$(nicket)$ = 5$. Is $g(x)$ is
    the corresponding generating series, what is $g(1)$? What is $g'(1)$?
}
\sol{
    $g(1)$ will be the number of coins in your pocket. This is trivially true
    because each term is $x$ to the power of an integer (with no coefficient),
    so $1$ raised to anything will be $1$ and so it is just the number of terms.
    More mathematically,

    \begin{align*}
        g(1) & = \sum_{s \in S} 1^{\omega(s)} \\
             & = \sum_{s \in S} 1             \\
             & = |S|
    \end{align*}

    $g'(1)$ will the amount of money you have. Based on the previous statement,
    we can see that the derivative of $g(x)$ is just the sum of the powers which
    represented the values of the coins in your pocket. More mathematically,
    \begin{align*}
        g'(1) = \sum_{s \in S} \omega(s)
    \end{align*}

    where $e_1 \ge 2$, $e_2 \ge 2$, $e_3 \ge 2$, $e_4 \ge 2$, and $e_5 \ge 2$.

\sol{
    Consider an arbitrary partition:

    \begin{align*}
        \young(~~~~,~~,~)

    This can obviously be decomoposed into the triple:

    \begin{align*}
        \Bigg ( \young(~~,~~) , \young(~~) , \young(~) \Bigg )

    There are a few cases to consider:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item First, this is unique. Clearly, this has to be unique
              because we are not changing any structure from the partition,
              but rather we are just decomposing it into a triple. So each
              partition must uniquely map to its own ordered triple. \\
        \item Second, $A_k$ is the partition with at most $k$ parts. $A_k$
              must have at most $k$ because the Durfee square is of size $k$. $A_k$
              cannot be largely than this because it would contradict either
              the definition of a partition or the definition of a Durfee square. \\
        \item Third, $B_k$ is the partition with first part of size at most $k$.
              This is true because if the first part of $B_k$ is larger than $k$, then
              this would contradict the definition of a Durfee square or a partition. \\

    Thus, we have shown that every partition can be decomposed into a triple.

\dfn{Self-conjugate Partition}{
    A partition is \textit{self-conjugate} i its transpose shape is the same
    as its original shape (e.g., the partitions (4,1,1,1) and (3,2,1)
    are self-conjugate, but (3,2) is not).
}

\qs{}{
    Prove that the number of self conjugate partitions of $n$
    equals the number of partitions using only distinct odd parts.
    Then derive an identity.
}
\sol{
First, we must prove the number of self conjugate partitions of $n$
equals the number of partitions using only distinct odd parts. This
can be done by showing a weight preserving bijection between the
two sets. \\

\dfn{Weight-preserving function}{
    Define the following function:

    \begin{align*}
        f : (S, \omega) \mapsto (S', \omega')
    \end{align*}

    such that $\omega : S \mapsto \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$
    and $\omega' : S' \mapsto \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ are weight functions.
    Then, $f$ is a weight-preserving function if and only if:

    \begin{align*}
        \omega(s) = \omega'(f(s)) \text{ for all } s \in S
    \end{align*}
}

And so, we can make the following claim

\clm{}{}{
    If $f : (S, \omega) \mapsto (S', \omega')$ is a weight-preserving
    and bijective  then,

    \begin{align*}
        g_{(S, \omega)}(x) = g_{(S', \omega')}(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]
    \end{align*}

    In other words, their generating functions are equal.
}

Now to define the actual bijection. Consider each row of the Ferrers
diagram of an arbitrary distinct odd partition. Each row can be
bent into a self-conjugate partition. By selecting the middle element,
which is gaurunteed to exist because the partition is odd, we can
place every square to the left below the middle element and leave
the other elements alone. Additionally, this is well defined as each
row is distinct. Thus, we have a weight preserving bijection
between the set of distinct odd partitions and the set
of self-conjugate partitions. \\

The generating function for the number of distinct odd partitions
is trivial and given by:

\begin{align*}
    g(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{\infty} 1 - x^{2i-1}
\end{align*}

as we only want to either select an odd number or not. \\

The generating function for the number of self-conjugate partitions
is more complicated. Consider an arbitrary self-conjugate partition
$\lambda$. We can decompose it into a triple $(D_k, A_k, B_k)$ through
the Durfee square decomposition. We can then apply a second weight-preserving
bijection and conjugate the second component of the triple which makes
$A_k = B_k$. Lastly, we can apply a third weight-preserving bijection
by compressing the triple into a tuple $(D_k, C_k)$ where $C_k$ is
$A_k$ merged left-to-right with $B_k$. \\

Consequently,

\begin{align*}
    C_k \in \bigcup_{j=0}^{\infty} D_j \times \text{Partitions}_{\text{even}_{\le j \text { tall}}} = U
\end{align*}

Clearly,

\begin{align*}
    g_{U}(x) & = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} x^{j^2} \Big ( \prod_{t=1}^{j} \frac{1}{1 - x^{2t}} \Big ) \\
             & = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{j^2}}{\prod_{t=1}^{j} \frac{1}{1 - x^{2t}}}
\end{align*}

So,

\begin{align*}
    \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} 1 + x^{2k - 1} = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{j^2}}{\prod_{t=1}^{j} 1 - x^{2t}}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Reason A}
Ordinary generating series typically won't have any algabraic properties
that are useful such as factorization. However, exponential generating
may have these properties. \\

\ex{}{

    \qs{}{
        Compute the ordinary and exponential generating series for
        $P(n,0), P(n,1), \dots$.

    \sol{
        Let's consider how a single $P(n,k)$ is constructed. There
        are $\binom{n}{k}$ ways to pick $k$ elements from $n$ set
        and $k!$ ways to order them. So,

        \begin{align*}
            P(n,k) & = \binom{n}{k}k!        \\
                   & = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}k! \\
                   & = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}

        \end{align*}

        Additionally, the exponential generating series is:

        \begin{align*}
            g_{\text{exp}}(x) & = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} P(n,i)\frac{x^i}{i!}              \\

\section{L23: Catalan Numbers}

\dfn{Rooted binary Tree}{
    A \textit{rooted binary tree} is a tree with a root such that each vertex has a left
    and right subtree. Let $G$ be the combinatorial set of these trees and
    $\omega : G \to \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ be the weight function that counts the number
    of vertices in the tree. Then a decomposition is as follows:

    \begin{align*}
        G \to \{ \emptyset \} \cup \{ \bullet \} \times G^2
    \end{align*}

    this is a weight preserving bijection. Hence we can obtain the functional equation:

    \begin{align*}
        g(x) = 1 + xg(x)^2
    \end{align*}

    Solving this formula for the quadratic equation gives us:

    \begin{align*}
        g(x) = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x}
    \end{align*}

    However, when exanding these equations we get that $\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x}$ has
    negative coefficients and thus is not a valid solution. Therefore, we have
    (by expansion of taylor series)

    \begin{align*}
        g(x) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x} = 1 + x + 2x^2 + 5x^3 + 14x^4 + 42x^5 \cdots
    \end{align*}

    Note that by our studies of generating series, $[x^n]g(x)$ is the number of rooted
    binary trees with $n$ vertices. The coefficients of this expansion are the Catalan
    numbers.
}

\subsubsection*{Dyck Paths}

Note that catalan numbers also count the number of Dyck paths. A Dyck path is a path
that starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at some arbitrary $(x,0)$. It will never fall below
the $x$-axis and will only use / and $\backslash$ to move from point $(x,y)$ to
$(x+1,y+1)$ or $(x+1,y-1)$.


\qs{}{
    Prove that the number of Dyck paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$ is

    \begin{align*}
        C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} \binom{2n}{n}
    \end{align*}

    in steps as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Count the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$.
        \item Show the number of bad paths is equal to the number of paths from $(0,0)$
              to $(2n,-2)$. Hint: consider the first time a path dips below the $x$-axis
              and "reflect" every step after that first step below the x-axis.
        \item Use the subtraction principle and simplify.
    \end{enumerate}
}

\sol{

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item  We will first begin by counting the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$. There
              are two ways to approach this. Since, we have to end at the same "level" as we start
              we need the same amount of steps up as we have down. Thus, there are $\binom{2n}{n}$ ways
              to pick the steps up and thus, the steps down are fixed. Second, we can consider all
              of the steps between these points as one big set. There must be $n$ steps up and $n$
              steps down. These steps can happen in any arragement. So, this question is just
              the number of permutations of this set which is $\frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} = \binom{2n}{n}$.
              Note that we must divide by $n!$ twice to account for the $n$ up steps that are
              identical and the $n$ down steps that are identical.
        \item We will now count the number of bad paths. A bad path is defined as any path
              that crosses below the $x$-axis. We can count this by creating a bijection
              bijection for a bad path from the first point that it crosses below the $x$-axis
              and taking a reflected step for every step after that below the x-axis. This path
              must end at $(2n,-2)$ because after it takes the bad step, there must have been more
              down steps than up steps. Because of this in the original graph there must be 1 more
              up step than down steps in the remaining path. Because we are reflecting each step,
              the bijected path will end up with 1 more down step from the point at which it crossed
              the $x$-axis which is at $y=-2$. To count the number of these paths, we can choose
              the $n+1$ steps that had to be taken down so $\binom{2n}{n+1}$.
        \item Lastly, using the subtraction principle, we have that the number of Dyck paths
              is

              \begin{align*}
                  \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n+1} & = \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} - \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!(n-1!)}                  \\
                                                  & = \frac{(2n!)}{n(n-1)!n!} - \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)(n)!(n-1)!}          \\
                                                  & = \frac{(2n)!}{n!(n-1)!} \Big ( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \Big ) \\

    A modification of the same argument shows the following: suppose $A$ and $B$ are

    we count the votes one at a time, tracking who is leading at each step. Then the
    total number of ways $A$ is always leading (or tied with) $B$ throughout the count
    is $C(a+b,a)-C(a+b,a+1)$. How?
}
\sol{
    This situation is counting the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to
    $(a+b,a-b)$. Similar to the previous question we can first
    calculate the number of total paths to $(a+b,a-b)$ and then
    subtract out the bad paths. The number of paths from $(0,0)$ to
    $(a+b,a-b)$ is $\binom{a+b}{a}$. To find the number of bad paths
    we can apply the reflection principle. Suppose they are tied at
    $k$ votes each meaning there have been $2k$ votes. Assume that the
    $2k+1$ vote goes to $b$. There are $a-k$ votes left for $A$ and
    $b-k-1$ votes left for $B$. Construct a bijection that reflects
    every vote (i.e. gives votes for $A$ to $B$ and vis-versa) after
    vote $2k+1$. Thus we will end with $b-1$ votes for $A$ and
    $a+1$ votes for $B$ and thus the graph will end at $(a+b,b-a-2)$
    because $b-1 - (a+1) = b-a-2$. Thus, the number of bad paths is
    the number of ways to choose the $a+1$ votes for $B$ which is
    $\binom{a+b}{a+1}$. Thus, the number of good paths is

    \begin{align*}
        \binom{a+b}{a} - \binom{a+b}{a+1}

    \item How many nonempty words can be formed from three As and five B's? (The "words" are

              We must consider each possible length from $1$ to $8$. At each length

                  \text{length 1: } & \binom{1}{0} + \binom{1}{1}                               \\

          \sol{
              Given that $5$ students have fixed grades of $A$, there are only $5$ $A$'s
              that can be distributed among the remaining $45$ students. So there are
              $\binom{45}{5}$ ways to distribute the $A$'s in this situation.

    \item Prove the identity: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$ COMBINATORIALLY by counting the same
          combinatorial set in two different ways (in other words, "double count"). (Do NOT give the standard
          induction proof, nor the "Gauss argument" of summing $1+2+\cdots+n$ and layering with $n+\cdots+2+1$.)

          \sol{
              Let $S$ be a set of distinct handshakes between $n$ people. We
              will count this in two ways:

              \begin{itemize}
                  \item There are clearly $\binom{n}{2}$ ways to form pairs in the room
                        which much give each other handshakes. Following this,
                        $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)! = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$. This is
                        exactly the RHS.
                  \item Decompose the set $S$ by individuals initiating the handshake.
                        The first person has $n-1$ choices to initiate a handshake.
                        The second has $n-2$ choices, and so on. By the addition principle,
                        we have $(n-1) + (n-2) + \cdots + 1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i$. which is
                        exactly the LHS.
              \end{itemize}

              Thus, because the LHS and RHS count the same set. It is clear that
              they are equivalent.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In how many ways can two red and four blue rooks be placed on an 8-by-8 board
          so that no two rooks can attack one another?

          \sol{
              Construct an algorithm that places the rooks on the board. First,
              place the red rooks individually on the board. Then, place the remaining
              blue rooks. Each time a rook is placed, the board loses one row and column
              of possible placements. Thus, there are $\frac{8^2\cdot 7^2}{2!}$. We must
              divide by $2!$ because the rooks are identical. Similarly for the blue rooks,
              there are $\frac{6^2\cdot 5^2\cdot 4^2 \cdot 3^2}{4!}$. Thus, the total number of ways is

              \begin{align*}
                  \frac{64\cdot 49\cdot 36\cdot 25\cdot 16\cdot 9}{2!\cdot 4!} = 8467200
              \end{align*}
          }

    \item Prove that the number of permutations of $m$ $A$'s and at most $n$ $B$'s equals
          $$\binom{m+n+1}{m+1}$$

          \sol{
              Consider the number of permutations of $m+1$ $A's$ and
              $n$ $B$'s. This is trivially counted by

              \begin{align*}
                  \binom{m+n+1}{m+1}
              \end{align*}

              This is because there are $m+n+1$ positions to place the $A$'s and $B$'s.
              There are $m+1$ positions to place the $A$'s which fixes the positions of $B$'s.
              Consider a bijective function $f$ from set the set of permutations of $m+1$ $A$'s and $n$ $B$'s
              to the set of permutations of $m$ $A$'s and at most $n$ $B$'s. \\

              $f$ can be defined by the following process. Find the last occurance of
              $A$ in the permutation and truncate the permutation at that point, removing
              every letter after this $A$. We must show that this function is well-defined,
              injective, and surjective. \\

              This function is obviously \textit{well-defined}. There is gaurunteed to be
              at least $1$ $A$. Thus, the output of this function will have $m+1-1=m$ $A$'s.
              Similarly, there could have been $0$ to $n$ $B$'s after the last $A$. So,
              there are at most $n$ $B$'s in the output. \\

              This function is \textit{injective} because this process is reversible.
              Consider $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are permutations of $m+1$ $A$'s and $n$ $B$'s.
              This means that they each had an $A$ truncated at the same position and the
              same number of $B$'s removed. Thus, $a_1=a_2$ which makes $f$ injective. \\

              This function is \textit{surjective}. Consider a permutation $\pi$ with $m$ $A$'s
              and at most $n$ $B$'s. We can append an $A$ to the end of $\pi$ and then append
              $n - |\pi|$. This must be a permutation with $m+1$ $A$'s and $n$ $B$'s. So,
              $f$ is surjective. \\

    \item Determine the number of towers of the form
          $\emptyset \subseteq A \subseteq B \subseteq \{1,2,\dots, n\}$. Note: there is no meaning to the word
          "towers" other than what is given.

          \sol{
              Consider $x \in \{1,2,\dots,n\}$. There are three cases for $x$:

              \begin{itemize}
                  \item $x \in A$
                  \item $x \in B$ (implying it is not in $A$)
                  \item $x \in \{1,2,\dots,n\}$
              \end{itemize}

              With $n$ possibilities for $x$, there are $3^n$ possible towers. \\

          \sol{
              Consider an arbitrary group $n$ boys and $n$ girls. Let $S$ be the set
              of all pairs that we can form from these two groups. \\

              The LHS precisely counts this because there are $\binom{2n}{2}$ ways
              to pick pairs from $2n$ total people. Decompose $S$ into the girl-girl
              pairs, boy-girl pairs, and boy-boy pairs. Clearly, there are $\binom{n}{2}$
              ways to form pairs in both the girl-girl pairs and boy-boy pairs individually.
              In the case of boy-girl pairs, we have $n$ choices for the first selection
              and $n$ choices for the second. Thus, there are $n^2$ ways to form boy-girl
              pairs. In total this is $2\binom{n}{2} + n^2$ which is the RHS. \\

              Since the LHS and RHS count the same set, they are equivalent.

    \item By counting the same set in two ways, prove the following identity:
          $$\sum_{k=0}^n {k\choose m}{n\choose k}={n\choose m}2^{n-m}$$

          \sol{
          Let $S$ be the set of all commitees we can form with a subcomittee of $m$
          members. The LHS counts the number of ways to form a committee and then
          form a subcomittee of $m$ members across all $n$ which is exactly $S$.
          The RHS forms the subcomittee first and then for the remaining $n-m$ people
          they are either in the commitee or not which is counted by $\binom{n}{m}2^{n-m}$.
          Since the LHS and RHS count the same set, they are equivalent. \\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item You are an amazingly successful hotelier; one of your properties is "Chez Four-Thirteen".
          Suppose there are $8$ distinguishable hotel rooms (numbered $101, 102,\dots,108$), each with maximum
          occupancy of $4$ people. A bus comes in with anywhere from $1$ to $32$ (distinguishable) people, but you
          do not know exactly how many. While waiting, you decide to calculate (making use of your UIUC Math
          413 education) the number of possible ways the people on the bus can spend the night in those hotel
          rooms so you can make a welcome sign. Determine this number. Use a computer to express the answer
          with all the digits (e.g., $31415926535897932384626433832795$); write down for your check-in clerk
          the order of magnitude (e.g., $10^{31}$). I recommend python to do the computation.
    \item What is the probability that a poker hand contains exactly one pair
          (that is, a poker hand with exactly four different ranks?)

          \sol{
              There are $\binom{52}{5}$ possible poker hands of size $5$. We can
              construct an algorithm to count the number of hands with exactly one pair.

              There are $\binom{13}{1}$ ways to choose the rank of the pair and
              $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to pick the actual cards in the hand. For the remaing cards in the hand,
              there are $\binom{12}{3}$ ways to pick ranks and $\binom{4}{1}$ choices
              for each rank selected. In total, the probability is:

              \begin{align*}
                  \frac{\binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{2} \binom{12}{3}\binom{4}{1}^3}{\binom{52}{5}}
              \end{align*}
          }

    \item A bagel store sells six different kinds of bagels. Suppose you choose $15$ bagels at random.
          What is the probability that your choice contains at least one bagel of each kind?
          If one of the bagels types is Sesame, what is the probability that your choice contains at
          least three Sesame bagels AND AT LEAST ONE BAGEL OF EACH KIND?

          \sol{
              In the first situation we are solving the question:

              \begin{align*}
                  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 15
              \end{align*}

              where each $x_i \ge 1$. This problem can equivalently rewritten such that

              \begin{align*}
                  y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5 + y_6 = 9
              \end{align*}

              where each $y_i \ge 0$. This has the solution:

              \begin{align*}
                  \binom{9+6-1}{6-1}=\binom{14}{5}
              \end{align*}

              Similarly, for the second question we have

              \begin{align*}
                  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 15 \\
              \end{align*}

              where $x_1 \ge 3$ and $x_i \ge 1$ for $i \ne 1$. Equivalently written:

              \begin{align*}
                  y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5 + y_6 = 7 \\
              \end{align*}

              where each $y_i \ge 0$. This has a solution of

              \begin{align*}
                  \binom{7+6-1}{6-1}=\binom{12}{5}
              \end{align*}

              There are a total of $\binom{15+6-1}{6-1}=\binom{20}{5}$ ways to choose 15 bagels
              without restrictions. Thus, the probabilities, respectively, are:

              \begin{align*}
                  \frac{\binom{14}{5}}{\binom{20}{5}} \quad \frac{\binom{12}{5}}{\binom{20}{5}}
              \end{align*}
          }

    \item Let $n$ be a positive integer. Suppose we choose a sequence $i_1,i_2,\dots,i_n$ of integers
          between $1$ and $n$ at random. What is the probability that the sequence contains
          exactly $n-2$ different integers?

          \sol{
              If $n-2$ integers are different that means either $1$ digit is repeated $3$ times
              or $2$ digits are repeated $2$ times. We can count the number of ways there are
              to form sequences of each type.

              \begin{itemize}
                  \item $1$ digit is repeated $3$ times:

                        \begin{align*}
                            \binom{n}{1} \binom{n-1}{n-3} \frac{n!}{3!}
                        \end{align*}

                  \item $2$ digits are repeated $2$ times:

                        \begin{align*}
                            \binom{n}{2} \binom{n-2}{n-4} \frac{n!}{2!2!}
                        \end{align*}
              \end{itemize}

              In total, there are obviously $n!$ ways to create sequence. So,
              the probabilities is:

              \begin{align*}
                  \frac{\binom{n}{1} \binom{n-1}{n-3} \frac{n!}{3!} + \binom{n}{2} \binom{n-2}{n-4} \frac{n!}{2!2!}}{n!}
              \end{align*}
          }

    \item Suppose $n$ people line up to get into $q$ different clubs. How many ways are there to do it?
          (The people are distinguishable and the order people are in line matters.)

          \sol{
              This is simply stars and bars/string cutting problem. We have $n$
              people total distributed among $q$ "boxes" where each box has at least
              $0$ people in it. Thus, the number of ways to split this group up is:

              \begin{align*}
                  \binom{n+q-1}{q-1}
              \end{align*}

              However, the order of the line matters, so we must account for all
              permutations of the line:

              \begin{align*}
                  \binom{n+q-1}{q-1}n!
              \end{align*}
          }

\section{Homework 4}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use the pigeonhole principle to prove that the decimal expansion of a rational
          number $\frac{m}{n}$ eventually is repeating. For example,
          $$\frac{34,478}{99,900} = 0.34512512512512512\cdots$$

    \item A student has $37$ days to prepare for an examination. From past experience she
          knows that she will require no more than $60$ hours of study. She also wishes to
          study at least $1$ hour per day. Show that no matter how she schedules her study
          time (a whole number of hours per day, however), there is a succession of days
          during which she will have studied exactly $13$ hours.

          Consider the sequence of days where she has studied for $a_i$
          hours on day $i$ (cummulative).

          \begin{align*}
              1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \cdots a_{37} \le 60
          \end{align*}

          It follows then that:

          \begin{align*}
              14 \le a_1 + 13 < a_2 + 13 < \cdots a_{37} + 13 \le 73
          \end{align*}

          We want to show that there exists $a_i = a_j + 13$ such that $j \le i$ as
          this would imply a sequence of days where she studied for $13$ hours.

          Between the two sequences, there are clearly, $37\cdot2 = 74$ numbers ranging in
          value from $1$ to $73$. By the pigeonhole principle, there
          are $74$ variables (pigeons) and $73$ numbers (pigeonholes) so
          there must be two "variables", i.e. an $a_i$ and $a_j + 13$
          such that $a_i = a_j + 13$.

          Thus, the student must have studied for exactly $13$ hours on some sequence
          of days.

    \item Prove that, for any $n + 1$ integers $a_1, a_2, \cdots ,a_{n+1}$, there exist two of the integers
          $a_i$ and $a_j$ with $i\ne j$ such that $a_i - a_j$ is divisible by $n$.

          When dividing numbers by $n$, there are only $n$ possible remainders
          $0,1,2,\cdots,n-1$. Since we have $n+1$ numbers, two of them must share
          the same remainder. Define the following:

          \begin{align*}
              a_i & = c_1n+r \\
              a_j & = c_2n+r
          \end{align*}

          It follows that:

          \begin{align*}
              a_i - b_j & = (c_1n + r) - (c_2n + r) \\
                        & = c_1n - c_2n             \\
                        & = n(c_1-c_2)
          \end{align*}

          Thus, by the definition of division, $n$ divides some $a_i - a_j$.

    \item There are $100$ people at a party. Each person has an even number (possibly
          zero) of acquaintances. Prove that there are three people at the party with the
          same number of acquaintances.



    \item Suppose that the $mn$ people of a marching band are standing in a rectangular
          formation of $m$ rows and $n$ columns in such a way that in each row each person
          is taller than the one to his or her left. Suppose that the leader rearranges the
          people in each column in increasing order of height from front to back. Show
          that the rows are still arranged in increasing order of height from left to right.

          (\textit{Hint}: For $n=2m$, consider the coefficient of $x^n$ in $(1-x^2)^n=(1+x)^n(1-x)^{-n}$.)\

          $$1 + \frac{1}{2}\binom{n}{1} + \frac{1}{3}\binom{n}{2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{n}{n} = \frac{2^{n+1}-1}{n+1}$$

    \item Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. Give a combinatorial proof of the identity

          $2$-subsets of $S$.

    \item Construct a partition of the subsets of ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$ into symmetric chains.

    \item A talk show host has just bought $10$ new jokes. Each night he tells some of the

          you never hear on one night at least all the jokes you heard on one of the other
          nights? (Thus, for instance, it is acceptable that you hear jokes $1$, $2$, and $3$ on
          one night, jokes $3$ and $4$ on another, and jokes $1$, $2$, and $4$ on a third. It is not
          acceptable that you hear jokes $1$ and $2$ on one night and joke $2$ on another night.)

\section{Homework 7}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the number of integral solutions of the equation $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 20$$ that satisfy
          $$1 \le x_1 \le 6, 0 \le x_2 \le 7, 4 \le x_3 \le 8, 2 \le x_4 \le 6$$

          \sol{
              We first need to reformat the question with adjusted restrictions:

              \begin{align*}
                   & y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 13                                         \\
                   & 0 \le y_1 \le 5, 0 \le y_2 \le 7, 0 \le y_3 \le 4, 0 \le y_4 \le 4
              \end{align*}

              This can be solved using the inclusion-exclusion principle: \\

              Let $S$ be the set of all solutions to the above equations where
              each $y_i \ge 0$. By stars and bars,

              $$
                  |S| = \binom{13 + 4 - 1}{13} = \binom{16}{13}
              $$

              Let $A_i$ be the set of all solutions such that $y_i \ge a_i$ where
              $a_i$ is the exclusive upper integral bound for $y_i$ (e.g. $y_1 \ge 6$) \\

              \begin{align*}
                  |A_1| = \binom{7 + 4 - 1}{7} = \binom{10}{7}         \\
                  |A_2| = \binom{5 + 4 - 1}{5} = \binom{8}{5}          \\
                  |A_3| = \binom{8 + 4 - 1}{8} = \binom{11}{8}         \\
                  |A_4| = \binom{8 + 4 - 1}{8} = \binom{11}{8}         \\
                  |A_1 \cap A_2| = 0                                   \\
                  |A_1 \cap A_3| = \binom{2 + 4 - 1}{2} = \binom{5}{2} \\
                  |A_1 \cap A_4| = \binom{2 + 4 - 1}{2} = \binom{5}{2} \\
                  |A_2 \cap A_3| = \binom{0 + 4 - 1}{0} = \binom{3}{0} \\
                  |A_2 \cap A_4| = \binom{0 + 4 - 1}{0} = \binom{3}{0} \\
                  |A_3 \cap A_4| = \binom{3 + 4 - 1}{3} = \binom{6}{3}
              \end{align*}

              Note that the intersection of any 3 sets will have no solution. \\

              Substituting this into the complementary form of the inclusion-exclusion
              principle, we get:

              \begin{align*}
                  \binom{16}{13} - \Bigg ( & \binom{10}{7} + \binom{8}{5} + \binom{11}{8} + \binom{11}{8}                       \\
                                           & - \binom{5}{2} - \binom{5}{2} - \binom{3}{0} - \binom{3}{0} - \binom{6}{3} \Bigg ) \\
                                           & = 96
              \end{align*}
          }

    \item Determine the number of permutations of $\{1, 2, \dots, 9\}$ in
          which at least one odd integer is in its natural position.
          \sol{
              This is an application of the inclusion-exclusion principle. \\

              Let $A_i$ be the set of all permutations such that $i$ is in its natural
              position. \\

              We must calculate $|A_1 \cup A_3 \cup A_5 \cup A_7 \cup A_9|$ for the inclusion-exclusion
              principle. \\

              For the sizes of each set individually, the size of each set
              must be $8!$ because there is one option for the position that
              must be in place and then we  must place the 8 remaining numbers.
              There are $\binom{5}{1}$ ways to pick the odd number in place. \\

              Following this pattern we can build the inclusion-exclusion principle
              as follows:

              \begin{align*}
                   & = \binom{5}{1} 8! - \binom{5}{2}7! + \binom{5}{3} 6! - \binom{5}{4} 5! + \binom{5}{5}4! \\
                   & = 157824
              \end{align*}
          }

    \item What is the number of ways to place six nonattacking rooks on
          the 6-by-6 boards with forbidden positions as shown?

          \begin{align*}
              \young(\times\times~~~~,\times\times~~~~,~~\times\times~~,~~\times\times~~,~~~~\times\times,~~~~\times\times)
          \end{align*}

          \sol{
              This is an application of the inclusion-exclusion principle. \\

              Let $S_n$ be the set of all boards with nonattacking rooks on an $n \times n$ board.
              Clearly, there are $n!$ boards within $S_n$. This can be
              observed by constructing an algorithm to place one rook at a time. \\

              Let $A_i$ be the set of all boards with exactly 1 rook in the forbidden
              in row $i$. \\

              We must calculate $$|A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap \cdots \cap A_n^c|$$

              Note that it is unecessary to consider each subset of $A_i$ individually,
              but rather we should consider the sum of the selected subsets. This gives
              the following identity

              \begin{align*}
                  \sum |A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}| = r_k (n - k)!
              \end{align*}

              where $r_k$ is the number of ways to place $k$ rooks in forbidden positions. \\

              Substituting this into the complementary form of the inclusion-exclusion
              principle, we get:

              \begin{align*}
                   & 6! - (r_1(6 - 1)! - r_2(6 - 2)! + r_3(6 - 3)! - r_4(6 - 4)! + r_5(6 - 5)! - r_6(6 - 6)!) \\
                   & = 6! - r_1(5!) + r_2(4!) - r_3(3!) + r_4(2!) - r_5(1!) + r_6(0!)                         \\
                   & = 6! - r_1(5!) + r_2(4!) - r_3(3!) + r_4(2!) - r_5 + r_6
              \end{align*}

              All that remains is to calculate $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_6$. \\

              \begin{align*}
                   & r_1 = 12                                                                                                                                         \\
                   & r_2 = \binom{3}{1}\cdot (2)+ \binom{3}{2} (4\cdot 4) = 3 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 16 = 6 + 48 = 54                                                      \\
                   & r_3 = \binom{3}{2} \binom{2}{1} \cdot (2 \cdot 4) + \binom{3}{3} (4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4) = 3\cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 + 1\cdot 64 = 48+64= 112         \\
                   & r_4 = \binom{3}{2} \binom{2}{1} \cdot 2 + \binom{3}{1} \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 3\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2 + 3\cdot 2\cdot 4\cdot 4 = 12 + 96 = 108 \\
                   & r_5 = \binom{3}{2} \binom{2}{1} \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 48                                                                                             \\
                   & r_6 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8
              \end{align*}

              Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

              \begin{align*}
                  6! - (12(5!) - 54(4!) + 112(3!) - 108(2!) + 48 - 8) = 80
              \end{align*}
          }

\section{Homework 8}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many ways are there to arrange the letters in INTELLIGENT
          with at least two pairs of consecutive identical letters? (For example
          ITTNELLGENI is an arrangement we want to count, since it has “TT”
          and “LL”.)

          \sol{
              This is an application of the inclusion-exclusion principle. \\

              Let $A_i$ be the set of all arrangements with exactly $i$ pairs of consecutive
              identical letters. \\

              We must calculate $$|A_2 \cup A_3 \cup \cdots \cup A_5|$$

              For $A_2$, there are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the two pairs of consecutive
              identical letters. There are 7 remaining letters with 3 remaining pairs
              which can be arranged in $\frac{7!}{2!2!2!}$ ways. \\

              For $A_3$, there are $\binom{5}{3}$ ways to choose the three pairs of consecutive
              identical letters. There are 5 remaining letters with 2 remaining pairs
              which can be arranged in $\frac{5!}{2!2!}$ ways. However,
              we must consider that the previous calculation $A_2$ double counted
              elements of $A_3$ by the number of pairs that were chosen, which was
              $2$. We must multiply this in to account for this.  \\

              Following this pattern, we can see the final answer is

              \begin{align*}
                  \binom{5}{2}\frac{9!}{(2!)^3} - 2\cdot \binom{5}{3}\frac{8!}{(2!)^2} + 3\cdot \binom{5}{4}\frac{7!}{(2!)} - 4\cdot \binom{5}{5}6!
              \end{align*}

              \nt{
                  Could probably use better explanations on why we need to multiply
                  by the number of pairs chosen in the previous calculation.
              }
          }

    \item Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ be
          all of the different prime numbers that divide $n$. Consider the
          Euler function $\phi$ defined by

          \begin{align*}
              \phi(n) = \big | \{ k : 1 \le k \le n, \gcd{(k,n)} = 1 \} \big |
          \end{align*}

          Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to show that

          \begin{align*}
              \phi(n) = n \prod_{i=1}^{n} 1 - \frac{1}{p_i}
          \end{align*}

    \item Prove that the Fibonacci sequence is the solution of the
          recurrence relation $$ a_n = 5a_{n-4} + 3a_{n-5}, (n \ge 5)$$
          where $a_0=0, a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=2, a_4=3$. Then use this formula
          to show that the Fibonacci numbers satisfy the condition that
          $f_n$ is divisble by $5$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $5$.

    \item Let $h_n$ equal the number of different ways in which the
          squares of a $1 \times n$ chessboard can be colored, using the
          colors red, white, and blue so that no two squares that are
          colored red are adjacent. Find and verify a recurrence relation
          that $h_n$ satisfies. Then find a formula for $h_n$ (using the
          characteristic equation method).

    \item The \textit{Lucas numbers} $l_0, l_1, l_2, \dots, l_n, \dots$
          are defined using the same recurrence relation defining the
          Fibonacci numbers, but with different intial conditions:
          $$l_n = l_{n-1} + l_{n-2}, (n \ge 2) \quad l_0 = 2, l_1 = 1$$

          \noindent
          Prove that

          \begin{itemize}
              \item $l_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n+1} \text{ for } n \ge 1$
              \item $l_0^2 + l_1^2 + \cdots + l_n^2 = l_n l_{n+1} + 2 \text{ for } n \ge 0$
          \end{itemize}

    \item Let $a_n$ equal  the number of ternary strings of length $n$ made
          up of $0$s, $1$s, and $2$s such that the substrings $00$, $01$, $10$,
          and $11$ never occur. Prove that $$a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}$$
          for $n \ge 2$ with $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1=3$. Then find a formula for
          $a_n$.

    \item A population grows as follows: in the current generation,
          each Canadian chooses one American for the next generation,
          and each American chooses one Canadian and one American for
          the next generation. Generation 0 consists of one Canadian.
          What is the size of generation $n$? (Here we assume all older
          generations leave when the new generation is chosen.)

\section{Homework 9}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that the partition function $p(n)(=\text{number of partitions of } n)$
          satisfies $p(n+1) > p(n)$.

          \sol{
              By the definition of a partition, we know there are $p(n)$ sequences of decreasing
              positive integers that sum to $n$. \\

              For each sequence, we can append a $1$ to the end to construct a new sequence,
              which will still be decreasing and sum to $n+1$. Therefore, we know that $p(n+1)$
              is \textit{at least} $p(n)$. \\

              Additionally, we can construct a new partition of the sequence $\{n+1, 0, 0, \dots\}$.
              This will be a partition of $n+1$ trivially. Additionally, this partition cannot
              be a partition of any integer less than $n+1$ as the sum is above $n$. Since,
              this partition is not in $n$, we know that $p(n+1) > p(n)$.
          }

    \item For each integer $n > 2$ determine a self-conjugate partitoin of $n$
          that has at least two parts.

          \sol{
              There are two cases to consider:

              \begin{itemize}
                  \item $n$ is odd \\

                        We can construct the follwing partition of $n$:

                        \begin{align*}
                            \{\frac{n-1}{2} + 1, 1_1, 1_2, \dots, 1_{\frac{n-1}{2}}\}
                        \end{align*}

                        where there are $\frac{n-1}{2}$ $1$s. This is self-conjugate as it will create
                        Ferrer Diagrams of the form:

                        \begin{align*}
                            \young(~~~~,~,~,~)
                        \end{align*}

                        Since $n > 2$, we know that there are at least two parts. At $n=3$,
                        $\frac{n-1}{2} + 1 = 2$ and $\frac{n-1}{2}=1$. So the partition is $\{2,1\}$. \\

                        This is trivially bijective because $\frac{n-1}{2}$ is bijective.

                  \item $n$ is even \\

                        We know that $n-1$ is odd. So we can construct a sel-conjugate partition for $n-1$
                        and then modify the generated sequence by changing one of the appended $1$s to a $2$.

                        This generates Ferrer Diagrams of the form:

                        \begin{align*}
                            \young(~~~~,~~,~,~)
                        \end{align*}

                        We have shown in the odd case that this is a bijection and partition,
                        so we know that this is a self-conjugate partition of $n$ because adding
                        $1$ to one of the parts is still a bijective action.
              \end{itemize}
          }

    \item Prove that the number of partitions of $n$ in which no part appears
          exactly once is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ with no
          parts congruent to $1$ or $5 \pmod{6}$.

    \item Do part (c) of the last in class exercise of Lecture 19.
          That is, give a bijective proof that the number of partitions
          of $N$ using distinct parts equals the number of partitions of
          $N$ using only odd parts. (Hint: Consider the multiplicity $m_p$
          of each part $p$ occuring in partitions of the second type.
          Now look at the unique expansion of $m$ as powers of $2$ and
          distribute.)

          \sol{
              Consider an arbitrary partition $P$ that only uses odd parts for $N$:

                  N = o_1 + o_2 + \cdots + o_k
              \end{align*}

              Group each odd number to obtain its multiplicity $m_p$ (e.g. 1 + 1 + 1 = 3(1)):

              \begin{align*}
                  N = m_1 (o_1) + m_2 (o_2) + \cdots + m_k (o_k)
              \end{align*}

              Consider the unique expansion of $m_p$ as powers of $2$:

              \begin{align*}
                  m_p = 2^0 + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^r
              \end{align*}

              Distribute each $o_i$ across the expansion of $m_p$:

              \begin{align*}
                   & = (2^0  + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^{r_1}) o_1 + (2^0  + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^{r_2}) o_2 + \cdots + (2^0  + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^{r_k}) o_k                                                              \\
                   & = 2^0 (o_{\alpha_1} + o_{\alpha_2} + \cdots + o_{\alpha_x}) + 2^1 (o_{\beta_1} + o_{\beta_2} + \cdots + o_{n_2}) + \cdots + 2^{r} (o_{\gamma_y} + o_{\gamma_2} + \cdots + o_{\gamma_z}) \\
              \end{align*}

              Let $a_i$ be the sum of the $o_i$s that correspond to the $2^i$ term:

              \begin{align*}
                   & = 2^0 a_0 + 2^1 a_1 + \cdots + 2^{r} a_r
              \end{align*}

              We know that each of these terms must be unique as each power of $2$ is unique in this sequence.

              Thus, we have constructed a bijection between the partitions of $N$ using only odd parts
              and the partitions of $N$ using distinct parts.

\section{Homework 10}

\begin{enumerate} %You can make lists!

    \item By considering partitions with distinct (that is, non-repeated) parts, prove that

          \begin{align*}
              \prod_{k\geq 1} (1+x^k)=1+\sum_{m\geq
                  1}\frac{x^{m(m+1)/2}}{\prod_{k=1}^m (1-x^k)}
          \end{align*}

          (Hint: look for a "maximal triangle" rather than a Durfee square.)

          Consider a similar approach to the Durfee Square decomposition. We know the generating series for distinct parts is

          \begin{align*}
              \prod_{k\ge 1}(1 + x^k)
          \end{align*}

          Consider an arbitrary partition $P$ with distinct parts:

          \begin{align*}
              \young(~~~~~,~~~~,~~~,~~,~)
          \end{align*}

          This can clearly be decomposed into a unique triple with a maximal triangle with side lengths $m$:

          \begin{multicols}{3}
              \begin{align*}
                  \young(~,~~,~~~)
              \end{align*}

              \columnbreak

              \begin{align*}
                  \young(~~~~,~~)
              \end{align*}

              \columnbreak

              \begin{align*}
                  \young(~~,~)
              \end{align*}
          \end{multicols}

          We can construct a weight preserving bijection by conjugating the second component.

          \begin{multicols}{3}
              \begin{align*}
                  \young(~,~~,~~~)
              \end{align*}

              \columnbreak

              \begin{align*}
                  \young(~~,~~,~,~)
              \end{align*}

              \columnbreak

              \begin{align*}
                  \young(~~,~)
              \end{align*}
          \end{multicols}

          We can construct another weight preserving bijection by merging the second and third component as follows

          \begin{multicols}{2}
              \begin{align*}
                  \young(~,~~,~~~)
              \end{align*}

              \columnbreak

              \begin{align*}
                  \young(~~,~~,~~,~,~,~)
              \end{align*}
          \end{multicols}

          Suppose this tuple is $TD$ (triangle-decomposed).

          \begin{align*}
              TD \in \Big ( T_m, \text{Partitions}_{\le m \text{ wide }} \Big ) = S
          \end{align*}

          A maximal triangle of size $m$ will have $\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$ "parts" as it can be constructed by constructing a square of $m \times m + 1$ and removing the top right part to leave the maximal triangle. Additionally, partitions with no part bigger than $m$ (i.e. a Ferrer Diagram with a maximum width of $m$) is represented by the generating series $\prod_{k=1}^{m} \frac{1}{1-x^k}$. In total, it is clear that

          \begin{align*}
              g(x) & = \sum_{m\ge 1} \Bigg ( \Big ( x^{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}} \Big ) \Bigg ( \prod_{k=1}^{m} \frac{1}{1-x^k} \Bigg ) \Bigg ) \\
                   & = \sum_{m\ge 1} \frac{x^{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}}}{\prod_{k=1}^{m}1-x^k}
          \end{align*}

          However, this bijection process does not hold for when $n=1$ as there will not be any element in the second part of the tuple. So, we must account for the $1$ missing element that is not being counted in this generating series. Thus,

          \begin{align*}
              \prod_{k\ge 1}(1 + x^k) = 1 + \sum_{m\ge 1} \frac{x^{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}}}{\prod_{k=1}^{m}1-x^k}
          \end{align*}

    \item Determine the number of $n$ digit numbers with all digits even, such that 2 and 4 each occur a nonzero, odd number of times.

          We can treat this as number of ways to $n$ objects (digits) into 5 buckets ($\{0,2,4,6,8\}$ where the number of objects must be nonzero and odd. This can be represented by the generating series:

          \begin{align*}
              g_{exp}(x) = \Big (1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots \Big )^3 \Big (x + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \cdots \Big )^2
          \end{align*}

          This can be simplified as follows:

          \begin{align*}
              g_{exp}(x) & = \big ( e^x \big )^3 \Big ( \frac{e^{-x} - e^{x}}{-2} \Big )^2 \\
                         & = \big ( e^{3x} \big) \frac{(e^{-x} - e^{x})^2}{4}              \\
                         & = \frac{ ( e^{3x} ) ( e^{-2x} - e^{0} - e^{0} + e^{2x} ) }{4}   \\
                         & = \frac{e^{5x} + e^{x} - 2e^{3x}}{4}                            \\
          \end{align*}

          We are solving for $[x^n]g_{exp}(x)$.

          \begin{align*}
              [x^n]g(x) = \frac{5^n + 1 - 2\cdot 3^n}{4}
          \end{align*}

    \item Determine the exponential generating series for the number of ways to put (distinct) people into $n$ rooms where each room has at least five people. Now determine the actual answer for 30,50,100 people in $n=5$ rooms (hint: use a computer or Wolfram Alpha).

          This is clearly recognized by the generating series:

          \begin{align*}
              g_{exp}(x) & = \Big ( \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \Big )^n                                                              \\
                         & = \Bigg ( \Big ( 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \cdots \Big ) - \Big (1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}\Big ) \Bigg )^n \\
                         & = \Bigg ( e^{x} - \Big (1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}\Big ) \Bigg )^n
          \end{align*}

          Let $n=5$. \begin{itemize}
              \item 30 people: 110145542812228123200
              \item 50 people: 80678086691658977883416415613497000
              \item 100 people: 100! * Number1/Number2 (See last page) (Number is too large, didn't include on this document)
          \end{itemize}

    \item Show that $\frac{e^x}{(1-x)^n}$ is the exponential generating function for the number of ways to choose some subset (possibly empty) of $r$ distinct objects and distribute them into $n$ different boxes with the order in each box counted.

          Let $A$ be the set of choosing $r$ distinct objects and placing them into one box. This is clearly represented by the generating series:

          \begin{align*}
              g_1(x) = e^x
          \end{align*}

          Similarly, let $B$ be the set of the chosen $r$ elements and the ways they can be placed into $n$ different boxes. This is clearly represented by the generating series

          \begin{align*}
              g_2(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)}
          \end{align*}

          Clearly, $S = A \star B$ which is the star product and thus, we can clearly see that the number of ways to choose a subset of $r$ and distribute $r$ elements into $n$ boxes is counted by $S$ which has a generating series:

          \begin{align*}
              g(x) = \frac{e^x}{(1-x)^n}
          \end{align*}

    \item Find the exponential generating series for the number of functions $f:A\to B$ where $A=\{1,2,...,n\}$ and $B=\{1,2,...,m\}$ such that the preimage set of every element of $B$ is at least size four, i.e., $\#f^{-1}(j)\geq 4$ for each $j\in B$.

          \begin{align*}
              g(x) = \Big ( e^x - (1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!}) \Big )^m
          \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

Note: The listed questions on exams are more questions than what was
on the exam. Typically, the exams have 5 questions, 6 points each, however
between two sections of the course, there are two variants of the exam.

\subsection*{Exam}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the number of integral solutions
          $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 413$$ subject to
          $$x_1 \ge 40, x_2 \ge 0, x_3 \ge 20, x_4 \ge -15, x_5 \ge -35$$

    \item Give a COMBINATORIAL PROOF of the following identity (i.e.,
          double count a set). A non-combinatorial proof will receive no credit.
          $$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 412^{n-k} = 413^n$$

    \item Count the number of ways to place four nonattacking rooks on a
          $8 \times 8$ chessboard such that neither the first row nor the first column is
          empty.

    \item Remember this problem from class: \textit{Let S be the set of permutations
              of at most $m$ $A$'s and at most $n$ $B$'s. The claim is}
          $$\#S = \binom{m+n+2}{m+1}-1 $$ Precisely define $S'$ which
          "obviously" has cardinality $\binom{m+n+2}{m-1}-1$ and giving a
          bijection $f: S \to S'$. Explain why your claimed bijection is
          WELL-DEFINED, i.e., given $w \in S'$ that indeed $f(w) \in S$.
          You do NOT need to show $f$ is injective or surjective here.

    \item Yihong and Zhuo are solving the Homework 2:

          \begin{quotation}
              \textit{In how many ways can two red and four blue rooks be
                  placed on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard so that no two rooks can
                  attack each other?}
          \end{quotation}

    \item What fraction of all of the arrangements of EFFLORESCENCE has
          consecutive Cs, consecutive Fs but no consecutive Es? For example
          ECCLROESFFENE is one such arrangement.

    \item Give a COMBINATORIAL proof of the following identity:
          $$\binom{2}{2}\binom{n}{2} + \binom{3}{2} \binom{n-1}{2} + \binom{4}{2}\binom{n-2}{2} + \cdots + \binom{n}{2} \binom{2}{2}=\binom{n+3}{5}$$

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find a recurrence relation for the number of different ways to hand
          out a piece of chewing gum (worth $1$ cent) or a candy bar (worth $10$
          cents) or a donut (worth $20$ cents), one item a day, until n cents worth
          of food has been given away. Don’t worry about the initial condition.

          \sol{
              Let $f(n)$ be the number of ways to hand out a piece of chewing gum,
              a candy bar, or a donut with $n$ cents. At any moment with $n$ cents,
              we can either give a piece of gum, a candy bar, or a donut. This gives

              \begin{align*}
                  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-10) + f(n-20)
              \end{align*}

          }
    \item  By using generating series, determine the number of integer solutions
          to the composition problem

          \begin{align*}
              e_1 + e_2 + e_3 = 22
          \end{align*}

          subject to $3 \le e_1 \le 8$, $6 \le e_2 \le 10$, and $2 \le e_3 \le 7$.

          \sol{
              Clearly this can be solved by the following generating series:

              \begin{align*}
                  g_1(x) = (x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6+x^7+x^8) (x^6+x^7+x^8+x^9+x^{10}) (x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6+x^7)
              \end{align*}

              where the solution is $[x^{22}] g(x)$. However, this is difficult to extract
              a coefficient from. Instead, rewrite the problem in terms of new variables:

              \begin{align*}
                  e_1 + e_2 + e_3 = 11
              \end{align*}

              where $0 \le e_1 \le 5$, $0 \le e_2 \le 4$, and $0 \le e_3 \le 5$.
              The generating series now becomes:

              \begin{align*}
                  g_2(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5) (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4) (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)
              \end{align*}

              where we are solving for $[x^{11}] g_2(x)$. This generating series can be simplified as follows:

              \begin{align*}
                  g_2(x) & = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5) (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4) (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5) \\
                         & = (\frac{1 - x^{6}}{1 - x}) (\frac{1 - x^5}{1 - x}) (\frac{1 - x^6}{1 - x})                 \\
                         & = \frac{(1 - x^{6}) (1 - x^5) (1 - x^6)}{(1 - x) (1 - x) (1 - x)}                           \\
                         & = \frac{(1 - x^{6}) (1 - x^5) (1 - x^6)}{(1 - x)^3}                                         \\
                         & = (1 - x^{6}) (1 - x^5) (1 - x^6) (1-x)^{-3}                                                \\
                         & = (1 - x^{5} - x^{6} + x^{11})(1-x^{6}) (1-x)^{-3}                                          \\
                         & = (1 - x^{5} - x^{6} + x^{11} - x^{6} + x^{11} + x^{12} - x^{17}) (1-x)^{-3}                \\
                         & = (1 - x^{5} - 2x^{6} + 2x^{11} + x^{12} - x^{17}) (1-x)^{-3}                               \\
              \end{align*}

              The target solution is $[x^{11}] g_2(x)$. Using negative binomial theorem,
              we can find the coefficient of $x^{11}$ as follows:

              Reminder that negative binomial theorem is:

              \begin{align*}
                  (1 - x)^{-n} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{n+k-1}{k} x^k
              \end{align*}

              \begin{align*}
                  [x^{11}]g_2(x) & = [x^{11}]((1 - x^{5} - 2x^{6} + 2x^{11} + x^{12} - x^{17}) (1-x)^{-3})                                                                                         \\
                                 & = [x^{11}] \Big ( (1-x)^{-3} - x^{5} (1-x)^{-3} - 2x^{6}(1-x)^{-3} + 2x^{11}(1-x)^{-3} + x^{12}(1-x)^{-3} - x^{17}(1-x)^{-3} \Big )                             \\

    \item Prove that the number of partitions where no part appears more
          than two times equals the number of partitions where no part is a
          multiple of three. (Hint: write down the generating series for the former
          type of partition and algebraically manipulate to get to the generating
          series for the latter type.)

    \item Determine the number of permutations of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$ in
          which no even integer is in its natural position. For example, $43258176$
          is good, but $42358176$ is bad because of the position of the 2.

          \sol{
              This is an application of inclusion-exclusion principle. \\

              Let $S$ be the set of all permutations of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$. Clearly,
              $|S| = 8!$. \\

              Let $A_i$ be the subset of permutations in $S$ where $i$ is in its natural position.
              We are looking to calculate the following by the complementary form of the
              inclusion-exclusion principle:

              \begin{align*}
                  |A_2^c \cap A_4^c \cap A_6^c \cap A_8^c| = |S| - \sum |A_i| + \sum |A_i \cap A_j| - \sum |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| + |A_2 \cap A_4 \cap A_6 \cap A_8| \\
              \end{align*}

              Each sum can be calculated as follows:

              \begin{align*}
                  \sum |A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cdots A_{i_k}| & = \binom{4}{k}(8-k)! \\
              \end{align*}

              This is because there are $4$ ways to choose the even numbers that are fixed.
              For each of these choices, there are $8-k$ ways to choose the remaining numbers. \\

              So, we have:

              \begin{align*}
                  8! - \binom{4}{1}7! + \binom{4}{2} 6! - \binom{4}{3} 5! + \binom{4}{4} 4!
              \end{align*}
          }

    \item Define what it means for a pair $(S, \omega)$ means to be combinatorial
          problem. Define generating series in these terms. State and prove the
          product lemma. (As usual, on the test I might ask a \textbf{very precise}
          question about these proofs (or any proof) so you must be able to
          understand each line and symbol used in the argument.)
